## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
today <- list(
  list("台北市",
       highest_temp =c(highest_temp = 25),
       lowest_temp =c(lowest_temp = 18)),
  list("新北市",
       highest_temp =c(highest_temp = 24),
       lowest_temp =c(lowest_temp = 15)))
tomorrow <- list(
  list("台北市",c(highest_temp = 25),c(lowest_temp = 18)),
  list("新北市",c(highest_temp = 24),c(lowest_temp = 15)))

weather <- list(today,tomorrow)

print(weather)
```
```{r}
weather[[1]][[2]][["highest_temp"]]
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
