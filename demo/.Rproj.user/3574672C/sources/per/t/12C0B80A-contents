## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
majors <- c("經濟學系","經濟學系","社會學系","社工系","經濟學系")
names <- c("小英", "小美", "大雄","阿華", "阿尼")
gender <- c("F","F","M","F","M")


econOnly <- c(T,T,F,F,T)
names [econOnly]
gender[econOnly]
econFemaleOnly <- c(T,T,F)
names [econOnly][econFemaleOnly]
```



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
